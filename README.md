# Comment Convert
This is a small tool I created to import the comments from my old blog (stored on Facebook) to the new one (stored on Disqus).

It may also export from Facebook comments to Wordpress.

## Known issues
* It's buggy but it does the job
* It reads only the first comment of the thread
* Titles with special characters may generate exceptions
